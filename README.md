# An Age Guessing App.

## About The App

I built this simple app using ReactJs and an Api from ''

Using some properties like Axious and Use Effect, we have a fun App.

## How It Works

When you enter your name, in the input box, based on the information fetched from the Api, it will guess your Age. The guess is usually wrong, lol, but it guesses anyway.

## Under The Hood.
My thinking is, there is some database that contains a list of almost all the names in the world, with an associated age, probably based off how the name sounds or the age range of people usually bearing that name, so that when a name is entered, the corresponding age is retrieved.

## The Thrill
I guess the thrill is more with checking what age the app thinks you should be because of your name, and even more to see if your name is recognized no matter how unfarmiliar it sounds.
